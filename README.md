# Quarkus Test Suite

The test suite includes:
- Bare metal scenario testing
- OpenShift scenario testing

For running the tests in OpenShift, it is expected that the user is logged into an OpenShift project:
- with OpenShift 4, run `oc login https://api.<cluster name>.<domain>:6443`

To verify that you're logged into correct project, you can run `oc whoami` and `oc project`.

Running the tests amounts to standard `mvn clean verify`.
This will use a specific Quarkus version, which can be modified by setting the `quarkus.platform.version` property.
Alternatively, you can use `-Dquarkus-core-only` to run the test suite against Quarkus `999-SNAPSHOT`.
In that case, make sure you have built Quarkus locally prior to running the tests.

Since this is standard Quarkus configuration, it's possible to override using a system property.
Therefore, if you want to run the tests with a different Java S2I image, run `mvn clean verify -Dquarkus.s2i.base-jvm-image=...`.

### Other prerequisites

In addition to common prerequisites for Java projects (JDK, Maven) and OpenShift (`oc`), the following utilities must also be installed on the machine where the test suite is being executed:

- an OpenShift instance where is enabled the monitoring for user-defined projects (see [documentation](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/monitoring/enabling-monitoring-for-user-defined-projects.html))
- the OpenShift user must have permission to create ServiceMonitor CRDs and access to the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` namespace:

For example, if the OpenShift user is called `qe`, then we should have this cluster role assigned to it:

```
kind: ClusterRole
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: monitor-crd-edit
rules:
- apiGroups: ["monitoring.coreos.com", "apiextensions.k8s.io"]
  resources: ["prometheusrules", "servicemonitors", "podmonitors", "customresourcedefinitions"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch", "create", "update", "patch", "delete"]
EOF
```

And also, the same user `qe` should have access to the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` namespace (this namespace is automatically created by the Prometheus operator when enabling the monitoring of user-defined projects):

```
oc adm policy add-role-to-user edit qe -n openshift-user-workload-monitoring
```

These requirements are necessary to verify the `micrometer/prometheus` and `micrometer/prometheus-kafka` tests. 

## Running against Red Hat build of Quarkus

When running against released Red Hat build of Quarkus make sure https://maven.repository.redhat.com/ga/ repository is defined in settings.xml.

Example command for released Red Hat build of Quarkus:
```
mvn -fae clean verify \
 -Dts.authenticated-registry \
 -Dversion.quarkus=1.3.4.Final-redhat-00004 \
 -Dquarkus.platform.group-id=com.redhat.quarkus
```

Example command for not yet released version of Red Hat build of Quarkus:

```
mvn -fae clean verify \
 -Dts.authenticated-registry \
 -Dversion.quarkus=1.7.1.Final-redhat-00001 \
 -Dquarkus.platform.group-id=com.redhat.quarkus \
 -Dmaven.repo.local=/Users/rsvoboda/Downloads/rh-quarkus-1.7.1.GA-maven-repository/maven-repository
```

If you want to run the tests using ephemeral namespaces, go to the [Running tests in ephemeral namespaces](#running-tests-in-ephemeral-namespaces) section for more information.

## Branching Strategy

The `main` branch is always meant for latest upstream/downstream development. For each downstream major.minor version, there's a corresponding maintenance branch:

  - `1.11` for Red Hat build of Quarkus 1.11.z (corresponding upstream version: `1.11.0.Final+`)

## Test Framework

We use a Quarkus QE Test Framework to verify this test suite. For further information about it, please go to [here](https://github.com/quarkus-qe/quarkus-test-framework).

## Name Convention 

For bare metal testing, test classes must be named `*IT`, executed by Failsafe.
OpenShift tests should be named `OpenShift*IT`.

### OpenShift Serverless / Knative

The test suite contains a Maven profile activated using the `include.serverless` property or `serverless` profile name.
This profile includes additional modules with serverless test coverage into the execution of the testsuite.
Serverless test coverage supports both JVM and Native mode.

The following command will execute the whole test suite including serverless tests:

```
./mvnw clean verify -Dinclude.serverless
```

## Existing tests

### `http-minimum`
Verifies that you can deploy a simple HTTP endpoint to OpenShift and access it.
It also verifies multiple deployment strategies like:
- Serverless
- Using OpenShift quarkus extension
- Using OpenShift quarkus extension and Docker Build strategy

### `http-advanced`
Verifies Server/Client http_2/1.1, Grpc and http redirections. 

### `config`

Checks that the application can read configuration from a ConfigMap and a Secret.
The ConfigMap/Secret is exposed by mounting it into the container file system or the Kubernetes API server.

### `sql-db`

Verifies that the application can connect to a SQL database and persist data using Hibernate ORM with Panache.
The application also uses RESTEasy to expose a RESTful API, Jackson for JSON serialization, and Hibernate Validator to validate inputs.
There are actually coverage scenarios `sql-app` directory:

- `postgresql`: the PostgreSQL JDBC driver; produces the PostgreSQL-specific build of the application and runs the OpenShift test with PostgreSQL
- `mysql`: same for MysQL
- `mariadb`: same for MariaDB
- `mssql`: same for MSSQL
- `multiple-pus`: An application with two persistence units defined in `application.properties`.

All the tests deploy a SQL database directly into OpenShift, alongside the application.
This might not be recommended for production, but is good enough for test.
Container images used in the tests are:

- PostgreSQL:
  - version 10: `registry.access.redhat.com/rhscl/postgresql-10-rhel7`
  - version 12: `registry.redhat.io/rhscl/postgresql-12-rhel7` (only if `ts.authenticated-registry` is set)
- MySQL:
  - version 8.0: `registry.access.redhat.com/rhscl/mysql-80-rhel7`
- MariaDB:
  - version 10.2: `registry.access.redhat.com/rhscl/mariadb-102-rhel7`
  - version 10.3: `registry.redhat.io/rhscl/mariadb-103-rhel7` (only if `ts.authenticated-registry` is set)
- MSSQL: `mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/rhel/server`

### `security/basic`

Verifies the simplest way of doing authn/authz.
Authentication is HTTP `Basic`, with users/passwords/roles defined in `application.properties`.
Authorization is based on roles, restrictions are defined using common annotations (`@RolesAllowed` etc.).

### `security/jwt`

Verifies token-based authn and role-based authz.
Authentication is MicroProfile JWT, and tokens are issued manually in the test.
Authorization is based on roles, which are embedded in the token.
Restrictions are defined using common annotations (`@RolesAllowed` etc.).

### `security/keycloak`

Verifies token-based authn and role-based authz.
Authentication is OIDC, and Keycloak is used for issuing and verifying tokens.
Authorization is based on roles, which are embedded in the token.
Restrictions are defined using common annotations (`@RolesAllowed` etc.).

A simple Keycloak realm with 1 client (protected application), 2 users and 2 roles is provided in `test-realm.json`.

### `security/keycloak-authz`

Verifies token-based authn and URL-based authz.
Authentication is OIDC, and Keycloak is used for issuing and verifying tokens.
Authorization is based on URL patterns, and Keycloak is used for defining and enforcing restrictions.

A simple Keycloak realm with 1 client (protected application), 2 users, 2 roles and 2 protected resources is provided in `test-realm.json`.

### `security/keycloak-webapp`

Verifies authorization code flow and role-based authentication to protect web applications.
Authentication is OIDC, and Keycloak is used for granting user access via login form.
Authorization is based on roles, which are configured in Keycloak.
Restrictions are defined using common annotations (`@RolesAllowed` etc.).

A simple Keycloak realm with 1 client (protected application), 2 users and 2 roles is provided in `test-realm.json`.

### `security/keycloak-jwt`

Verifies authorization code flow using JWT token and role-based authentication to protect web applications.
Authentication is OIDC, and Keycloak is used for granting user access via login form.
Authorization is based on roles, which are embedded in the token.
Restrictions are defined using common annotations (`@RolesAllowed` etc.).

A simple Keycloak realm with 1 client (protected application), 2 users and 2 roles is provided in `test-realm.json`.

### `security/keycloak-oauth2`

Verifies authorization using OAuth2 protocol. Keycloak is used for issuing and verifying tokens.
Restrictions are defined using common annotations (`@RolesAllowed` etc.).

### `security/keycloak-multitenant`

Verifies that we can use a multitenant configuration using JWT, web applications and code flow authorization in different tenants. 
Authentication is OIDC, and Keycloak is used.
Authorization is based on roles, which are configured in Keycloak.

A simple Keycloak realm with 1 client (protected application), 2 users and 2 roles is provided in `test-realm.json`.

### `security/keycloak-oidc-client`

Verifies authorization using `OIDC Client` extension as token generator. 
Keycloak is used for issuing and verifying tokens.
Restrictions are defined using common annotations (`@RolesAllowed` etc.).

A simple Keycloak realm with 1 client (protected application), 2 users and 2 roles is provided in `test-realm.json`.

### `security/https`

Verifies that accessing an HTTPS endpoint is posible.
Uses a self-signed certificate generated during the build, so that the test is fully self-contained.

This test doesn't run on OpenShift (yet).

### `microprofile`

Verifies combined usage of MicroProfile RestClient, Fault Tolerance and OpenTracing.

The test hits a "client" endpoint, which uses RestClient to invoke a "hello" endpoint.
The response is then modified in the "client" endpoint and returned back to the test.
The RestClient interface uses Fault Tolerance to guard against the "hello" endpoint errors.
It is possible to enable/disable the "hello" endpoint, which controls whether Fault Tolerance is used or not.

All HTTP endpoints and internal processing is asynchronous, so Context Propagation is also required.
JAX-RS endpoints and RestClient calls are automatically traced with OpenTracing, and some additional logging into the OpenTracing spans is also done.
Jaeger is deployed in an "all-in-one" configuration, and the OpenShift test verifies the stored traces.

### `micrometer/prometheus`

Verifies that custom metrics are exposed in the embedded Prometheus instance provided by OpenShift.

There is a PrimeNumberResource that checks whether an integer is prime or not. The application will expose the following custom metrics:
- `prime_number_max_{uniqueId}`: max prime number that was found
- `prime_number_test_{uniqueId}`: with information about the calculation of the prime number (count, max, sum)

Where `{uniqueId}` is an unique identifier that is calculated at startup time to uniquely identify the metrics of the application.

In order to run this module, the OpenShift user must have permission to create ServiceMonitor CRDs and access to the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` namespace. See [Other Prerequisites](#other-prerequisites) section.

### `micrometer/prometheus-kafka`

Verifies that the kafka metrics are exposed in the embedded Prometheus instance provided by OpenShift.

As part of this application, there is one Kafka consumer and one Kafka producer, therefore consumer and producer metrics are expected.

In order to run this module, the OpenShift user must have permission to create ServiceMonitor CRDs and access to the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` namespace. See [Other Prerequisites](#other-prerequisites) section.

### `messaging/artemis`

Verifies that JMS server is up and running and Quarkus can communicate with this service.

There is a PriceProducer that pushes a new integer "price" to a JMS queue called "prices" each second.
PriceConsumer is a loop that starts at the beginning of the application runtime and blocks on reading
from the queue called "prices". Once a value is read, the attribute lastPrice is updated.
Test checks that the value gets updated.

### `messaging/artemis-jta`

Verifies that JMS server is up and running and Quarkus can communicate with this service using either transactions or client acknowledge mode.

There are three JMS queues, `custom-prices-1` and `custom-prices-2` are used to test
a transactional write: either both are correctly updated with a new value or none of them is.

`custom-prices-cack` queue is used to check that messages remains waiting in the queue until
client "acks" them, i.e. acknowledges their processing.

### `messaging/amqp-reactive`

Verifies that JMS server is up and running and Quarkus can communicate with this service.
This module is using Reactive Messaging approach by leveraging `quarkus-smallrye-reactive-messaging-amqp` extension.

There is a PriceProducer that generates message every second, the value of the message is "tick number" multiplied by 10 modulo 100.
PriceConsumer puts received number into ConcurrentLinkedQueue of Integers.
State of this queue is exposed using PriceResource which is called from the test.

### `messaging/kafka-streams-reactive-messaging`

Verifies that `Quarkus Kafka Stream` and `Quarkus SmallRye Reactive Messaging` extensions works as expected. 

There is an EventsProducer that generate login status events every 100ms. 
A Kafka stream called `WindowedLoginDeniedStream`  will aggregate these events in fixed time windows of 3 seconds. 
So if the number of wrong access excess a threshold, then a new alert event is thrown. All aggregated events(not only unauthorized) are persisted. 

### `messaging/kafka-avro-reactive-messaging`

Verifies that `Quarkus Kafka` + `Apicurio Kakfa Registry`(AVRO) and `Quarkus SmallRye Reactive Messaging` extensions work as expected. 

There is an EventsProducer that generate stock prices events every 1s. The events are typed by an AVRO schema.  
A Kafka consumer will read these events serialized by AVRO and change an `status` property to `COMPLETED`. 
The streams of completed events will be exposed through an SSE endpoint. 

### `messaging/qpid`

Verifies that JMS server is up and running and Quarkus can communicate with this service.
Similar to `messaging/artemis` scenario but using `quarkus-qpid-jms` extension to communicate with the server.

There is a PriceProducer that pushes a new integer "price" to a JMS queue called "prices" each second.
PriceConsumer is a loop that starts at the beginning of the application runtime and blocks on reading
from the queue called "prices". Once a value is read, the attribute lastPrice is updated.
Test checks that the value gets updated.

### `scaling`

An OpenShift test verifying that an OpenShift deployment with a Quarkus application scales up and down.

This test could be extended with some metric gathering.
